## Overview

`PingPush` delivers the Push MFA capabilities for the Ping Identity iOS SDK. It mirrors the Android Push implementation and shares a consistent client-driven architecture:

- **PushClient** – Public façade offering credential management, notification processing, and response APIs.
- **PushService** – Internal actor enforcing business rules, policy evaluation, and handler orchestration.
- **PushHandler** – Pluggable provider interface; the default `PingAMPushHandler` covers PingAM flows while custom handlers can be registered per platform.
- **Storage** – `PushKeychainStorage` (default) plus `PushStorage` protocol for custom persistence strategies.
- **Utilities** – Notification cleanup, device-token management, and URI parsing utilities shared across the module.

The module requires **iOS 16+** and **Swift 6** with Structured Concurrency enabled. Networking is handled by `PingNetwork.HttpClient`, policy evaluation by `PingCommons.MfaPolicyEvaluator`, and secure storage by Keychain APIs.

## Installation

### Swift Package Manager

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/ForgeRock/ping-ios-sdk.git", branch: "main")
]
```

Add the `PingPush` product to your target dependencies.

### CocoaPods

```ruby
pod 'PingPush', :git => 'https://github.com/ForgeRock/ping-ios-sdk.git'
```

## Configuration & Initialization

Use the DSL-style factory to create a `PushClient` with optional overrides:

```swift
import PingPush

let pushClient = try await PushClient.createClient { config in
    config.logger = PingLogger(logLevel: .debug)
    config.enableCredentialCache = true
    config.notificationCleanupConfig = .hybrid(
        maxNotifications: 50,
        maxNotificationAgeDays: 14
    )
}
```

If `config.storage` or `config.policyEvaluator` are not provided, the client wires in `PushKeychainStorage` and `MfaPolicyEvaluator.create()` automatically.

## Credential Lifecycle

Register via pushauth URI (e.g. QR code) and manage stored credentials:

```swift
let credential = try await pushClient.addCredentialFromUri(enrollmentUri)

let credentials = try await pushClient.getCredentials()
let specific = try await pushClient.getCredential(credentialId: credential.id)

try await pushClient.deleteCredential(credentialId: credential.id)
```

Policy evaluation occurs during registration and retrieval. Failing policies lock credentials (`PushError.credentialLocked`) until compliance is restored.

## Device Token Management

```swift
try await pushClient.setDeviceToken(apnsTokenString)
let currentToken = try await pushClient.getDeviceToken()
```

Passing `credentialId` updates only that credential; otherwise the token is propagated to every stored credential via the configured handlers.

## Notification Processing

Supports APNs payloads, string (JWT) payloads, and `userInfo` dictionaries:

```swift
if let notification = try await pushClient.processNotification(messageData: apnsPayload) {
    // render notification to user
}

let jwtNotification = try await pushClient.processNotification(message: jwtString)
let userInfoNotification = try await pushClient.processNotification(userInfo: userInfo)
```

Automatic cleanup runs after each successful parse based on `NotificationCleanupConfig`.

## Notification Responses

```swift
try await pushClient.approveNotification(notificationId)
try await pushClient.approveChallengeNotification(notificationId, challengeResponse: "1234")
try await pushClient.approveBiometricNotification(notificationId, authenticationMethod: "face")
try await pushClient.denyNotification(notificationId)
```

Responses are routed through the registered `PushHandler` for the credential’s platform. Empty challenge responses or authentication methods throw `PushError.invalidParameterValue`.

## Notification Queries & Cleanup

```swift
let pending = try await pushClient.getPendingNotifications()
let all = try await pushClient.getAllNotifications()
let specificNotification = try await pushClient.getNotification(notificationId: id)

let removed = try await pushClient.cleanupNotifications(credentialId: optionalCredentialId)
await pushClient.close() // clears caches and runs global cleanup
```

`close()` should be invoked when the client is no longer needed (e.g., user sign-out) to clear caches and run a final cleanup pass.

## APNs Integration Checklist

1. Register for remote notifications and obtain the APNs token.
2. Pass the raw device token string to `setDeviceToken`.
3. Ensure the token is updated on every launch and whenever APNs indicates a change.
4. Forward payloads received in `application(_:didReceiveRemoteNotification:fetchCompletionHandler:)` or `userNotificationCenter(_:didReceive:withCompletionHandler:)` to `processNotification`.

## Error Handling

`PushClient` surfaces domain-specific `PushError` cases:

- `.invalidUri`, `.invalidParameterValue`
- `.deviceTokenNotSet`, `.credentialLocked`
- `.messageParsingFailed`, `.networkFailure`, `.storageFailure`

Most methods throw; callers should `try`/`catch` and map to user-facing messaging or retry logic. Integration tests exercise both success and failure flows to match Android parity.

## Testing Strategy

- `PushIntegrationTests` cover registration, notification processing, device token updates, policy enforcement, and error scenarios.
- `PushServiceTests` focus on service-level business logic and caching.
- Unit utilities such as `TestInMemoryPushStorage` and `IntegrationPushHandler` keep tests deterministic.
- Recommended command:

```bash
xcodebuild test \\
  -scheme PingTestHost \\
  -workspace SampleApps/Ping.xcworkspace \\
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16,OS=18.3.1' \\
  -only-testing:PushTests/PushIntegrationTests
```

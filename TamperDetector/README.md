# PingTamperDetector

PingTamperDetector module for the Ping iOS SDK.

## How to use

The `TamperDetector` class is responsible for analyzing and providing a score indicating whether the device is suspicious of being jailbroken. It uses a set of detectors, each performing a specific check.

### Default Usage

To use the `TamperDetector` with the default set of detectors, simply create an instance of the class and call the `analyze()` method:

```swift
let tamperDetector = TamperDetector()
let score = tamperDetector.analyze()

if score > 0 {
    print("The device is likely jailbroken. Score: \(score)")
} else {
    print("The device is likely not jailbroken.")
}
```

The `analyze()` method returns a score between 0.0 and 1.0, where 1.0 indicates a high probability of a jailbroken device.

### Built-in Detectors

The `TamperDetector` includes the following built-in detectors, which are available through the `TamperDetector.defaultDetectors` static property:

- `SuspiciousFilesExistenceDetector`: Checks for the existence of files that are commonly found on jailbroken devices.
- `SuspiciousFilesAccessibleDetector`: Checks if suspicious files can be accessed.
- `URLSchemeDetector`: Checks if well-known URL schemes used by jailbreak tools can be opened.
- `RestrictedDirectoriesWritableDetector`: Checks if it is possible to write to restricted directories.
- `SymbolicLinkDetector`: Checks for the presence of symbolic links that are common on jailbroken devices.
- `DyldDetector`: Checks for suspicious dynamic libraries loaded into the application.
- `SandboxDetector`: Checks if the application is running outside of the sandbox.
- `SuspiciousObjCClassesDetector`: Checks for the presence of suspicious Objective-C classes.
- `SandboxRestrictedFilesAccessable`: Checks if restricted files are readable.

### Custom Detectors

You can also create your own custom detectors. To do this, you need to create a class that conforms to the `TamperDetectorProtocol` and implement the `analyze()` method.

Here is an example of a custom detector:

```swift
import Foundation

class MyCustomDetector: TamperDetectorProtocol {
    func analyze() -> Double {
        // Implement your custom jailbreak detection logic here
        // Return a score between 0.0 and 1.0
        return 0.0
    }
}
```

### Combining Default and Custom Detectors

You can easily combine the default detectors with your own custom detectors.

#### Adding Custom Detectors to the Default Set

If you want to use the default detectors and add your own, you can use the `init(customDetectors:)` initializer:

```swift
let customDetector = MyCustomDetector()
let tamperDetector = TamperDetector(customDetectors: [customDetector])
let score = tamperDetector.analyze()
```

#### Creating a Custom Set of Detectors

If you want to use a specific set of detectors, you can create your own array of detectors and pass it to the `init(detectors:)` initializer. You can use the `TamperDetector.defaultDetectors` static property to get the array of default detectors and modify it as you wish.

```swift
let customDetector = MyCustomDetector()
var detectors = TamperDetector.defaultDetectors
detectors.append(customDetector)

let tamperDetector = TamperDetector(detectors: detectors)
let score = tamperDetector.analyze()
```
